## Few words about myself:

I was born in 1978 and I am from generation X. On my life path, I changed several professions (HR inspector, storekeeper, salesman, manager, entrepreneur, IT manager), from which I drew knowledge to the last drop. I know all stages of online trading. I created my own online store in WordPress. Participated in the development of the site, integrations and software for online trading. I have experience in SMM and SEO, as well as product photography. Promoted to leadership positions.

I've been into IT since I first saw a computer. I am constantly engaged in self-study, taking courses to improve my knowledge and skills. I study marketing and improve my English. I have a strategic mind. I am for optimization and automation. I have experience in creating training material (instructions, scripts, etc.) and training employees. I know how to find a common language and work with people. I take my work seriously and I am a perfectionist to some extent. I completely immerse myself in work, achieve my goals and stand up for the company where I work. I am fond of different sports, for healthy lifestyle, without bad habits.

Now my goal is to take the course of the RSschool, learn to be a Front-end developer (possibly a full stack) in order to find a decent job or develop my own applications and integrations. I hope this will radically change my life and the life of my family for the better. I hope you appreciate my CV.
